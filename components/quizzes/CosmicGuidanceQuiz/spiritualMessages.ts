      teaserMessage: "It's time to let go and begin again...",
      mainMessage: `Dear ${insights.userName}, the Universe is gently asking you to release what no longer serves your highest good. Like autumn leaves falling to nourish new growth, you are being called to let go of old patterns, relationships, or beliefs that have become heavy burdens on your soul. This is not about loss‚Äîit's about making space for miracles to enter your life. Your spirit is ready for a profound transformation, and the first step is releasing your grip on what was, so you can embrace what is meant to be.`,
      whyNow: `The cosmic energies surrounding your birth month of ${getMonthName(insights.birthMonth)} have aligned with your current life circumstances to create this perfect moment of release. Your soul chose this time to shed its old skin because you have grown beyond your previous limitations. The Universe has been preparing you for this moment through recent challenges and shifts in your energy. You're ready to step into a new version of yourself.`,
      nextSteps: `Begin by identifying three things in your life that feel heavy or draining. This could be a relationship, a habit, a fear, or even a physical possession. Create a sacred ritual of release‚Äîwrite them down and burn the paper under the full moon, or simply speak your intention to let go while holding a piece of rose quartz. Trust that as you release, the Universe will fill the empty spaces with blessings beyond your imagination.`,
      signsToWatch: `Watch for synchronicities involving butterflies, doors opening unexpectedly, or people from your past reaching out. You may also notice repeated number sequences like 1111 or 444. Pay attention to dreams about flying, water, or cleaning‚Äîthese are your soul's way of confirming the release process. New opportunities will appear within 2-3 weeks of your conscious release work.`,

You have been giving so much of yourself to others that you may have forgotten to maintain healthy boundaries around your time, energy, and emotional well-being. This is not about becoming closed-off or fearful‚Äîit's about honoring your sensitivity as a gift and creating a sacred container for your spiritual growth.
